          Breaking ground on a career as a full-stack software developer, I am a former career cook and chef seeking a junior position in the tech industry.
          I recently graduated from the Flatiron School’s Software Engineering Program, and I’m currently working in Ruby, Javascript, React and Redux with UI experience in React, HTML and CSS. 
          In addition, I have a strong working knowledge in graphic design/illustration techniques using Adobe Creative Suite, formerly working on contract with Nike for the NikeSB print advertisement campaigns.
          With over ten years in the food service industry,I have a proven track record of team management, project management and professional consultation. My career highlights include my time as Head Chef of the Derby Cafe where I developed a rotating, seasonal breakfast and brunch menu. Later, while mentoring under James Beard award winning chef Johnny Leach, I successfully implemented systems to educate servers on our menus, cooking techniques, local food purveyors, and service protocols resulting in more knowledgeable front of house staff and more efficient dining-room-service. I bring my curiosity and passion for experimentation from my life in the kitchen to my software development practice and plan to expand my knowledge base and become an integral team member in a software engineering or web development role.
